---
**README, AUTHORS**
- This project aims at developing a web application with HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API and front-end integration.

**Each task is linked and will help:**
- Put in place a parent class to take care of initialization, serialization and deserialization of the future instances.
- Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
- Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place) that inherit from the parent class.
- Create the first abstract storage engine of the project File storage.
- Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.
